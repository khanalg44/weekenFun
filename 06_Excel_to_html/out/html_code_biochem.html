    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" Analysis of iron content of 10 vegetarian food samples belonging to three different food (spices, lentils and locally available vegetables) categories was the objective of this study. UV-Vis spectrophotometry was used to estimate and evaluate the levels of iron in the studied vegetables, lentils and spices. Vegetarians are more vulnerable to the deficiency of iron as they consume non-heme iron which needs to be altered before it can be absorbed by the body. While, non-vegetarians are rarely a victim of iron deficiency as their diet consists of meat through which they consume proteins like hemoglobin and myoglobin directly in the unaltered form. Inevitably, there is a need to measure the amount of iron in the vegetarian food products to determine which food sources are rich in iron, so that they may be consumed during iron deficiency. Spectrophotometric technique of analysis was used to determine the iron content. It works on principle of the Beer-Lambert law. From the results thus obtained, the maximum contribution was shown by spices and condiments towards the dietary iron content whereas the minimum contribution was shown by vegetables and lentils.

Keywords: Beer-Lambert law, Iron content, Vegetables.

    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" In addition to transferring genetic information, RNA performs a wide variety of functions to maintain biological homeostasis in different cellular environments. RNA molecules often fold into 3-dimensional architectures to perform their functions and therefore, understanding of their 3-dimensional structures help us to reveal how these molecules perform their functions and provide a key insight for developing targeted therapeutics. Among several biophysical methods, X-ray crystallography has been the most developed and most widely used method for determining the high-resolution structures of biomacromolecules including RNA molecules. However, RNA and RNA-protein complex structures represent only a small fraction of all deposited high-resolution structures in the protein data bank, underscoring the difficulties associated with the RNA crystallography. We have been developing RNA binding proteins, specifically synthetic antibodies, as chaperones for the RNA crystallography. Using this strategy, we have solved several crystal structures of antibody-RNA complexes where antibodies have been advantageous for the crystallization by mediating majority of the crystal contacts, trapping a specific conformation sampled by the target RNA and helping in initial phasing by serving as molecular replacement models. Many of our antibody-RNA modules are portable and can be easily engineered into an RNA of interest as affinity tags for wide variety of applications beyond crystallography such as RNA imaging and immunoprecipitation. We have also developed anti-RNA antibodies that specifically inhibits the translation mediated by a viral internal ribosome entry site, suggesting that anti-RNA antibodies themselves have potential as new class translation inhibitors for developing the antiviral therapeutics.

    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" Understanding the interactions of proteins with the complex environment of cellular membranes is a fundamental problem in biophysics. These interactions are important because they determine the three-dimensional structure and ultimately the function of membrane proteins, a large class of pharmaceutically relevant macromolecules that reside within cellular membranes. Conventional biochemical methods have been used to study protein-membrane interactions but elucidating mechanistic details from such assays has proven to be challenging. Here, I will discuss a project focused on the cancer-related membrane protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) that plays a major role in human disease and drug disposition because of its ability to pump a chemically diverse range of drugs out of the cell. Deciphering the drug-induced conformational changes is key to understanding the molecular basis of transport and to developing novel pharmaceuticals. We directly imaged individual P-gp transporters reconstituted into a lipid bilayer membrane and studied the protein structure and structural dynamics in physiological buffer solution. This work provides a foundation for future studies such as imaging the structural consequences of cancer drug binding to P-gp in near-native conditions. "

    <td>" Herein, for the first time, we report copper-cysteamine (Cu-Cy) nanoparticles having Cu1+ instead of Cu2+ as an efficient heterogeneous Fenton-like catalyst for highly selective cancer treatment. Initial measurements of Cu-Cy’s hydroxyl radical generation ability show that it behaves as a Fenton-like reagent in the presence of H2O2 (100 μM) at pH 7.4, and that its Fenton-like activity is dramatically enhanced under acidic conditions (pH 6.5 and 5.5). Notably, Cu-Cy exhibits high stability and minimal copper release during the Fenton-like reaction, demonstrating its potency as a heterogeneous Fenton-like catalyst with a low cytotoxic effect. Through extensive in vitro studies, Cu-Cy NPs are found to generate a significantly higher level of ROS, thereby causing significantly more destruction to cancerous cells than to normal cells without the need for exogenous additives, such as H2O2. To the best of our knowledge, the average IC-50 value of Cu-Cy to cancer cells (11 μg/mL) is the lowest among reported heterogeneous Fenton-like nanocatalyst so far. Additionally, compared to cancer cells, Cu-Cy NPs display substantially higher IC-50 value toward normal cells (50 μg/mL), suggesting high selectivity. Overall, Cu-Cy NPs can participate in heterogeneous Fenton-like activity with elevated H2O2 under acidic conditions to produce significantly higher levels of hydroxyl radicals in cancer cells when compared to normal cells, resulting in selective cytotoxicity to cancer cells.

    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" Ricobendazole (RBZ) is an active metabolite of Albendazole (ABZ) acting as an anthelmintic drug used to treat internal parasites in humans and animals. The current work aims to study the structural, spectroscopic (IR and Raman) and physicochemical properties of RBZ, from an experimental and computational approach. The conformational analysis of the title molecule was performed around eight flexible bonds by employing density functional theory (DFT) at B3LYP/6-311++G (d, p) level and three stable conformers (conformer I, II and III) have been predicted. The vibrational spectra (IR and Raman) have been recorded in the solid phase showed a good agreement with theoretical spectra. The chemical reactivity prediction with the frontier molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gap reveals that conformer I is the most stable with the highest energy gap among the three conformers, while conformer III is more chemically reactive due to least energy gap. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) flourished that the sulfinyl group is more electrophilic and N7H31 is more nucleophilic in nature. The local reactivity descriptor explored the idea about the reactive sites for further attacks from surrounding species. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis suggested that lone pair interaction from LP(1)N7→π*(N6-C16) is responsible for the stability of RBZ with the stabilization energy 61.96 kcal/mol. QTAIM study demonstrates that there exist two intramolecular hydrogen bonding in RBZ. Binding sites of RBZ has been carried out against three proteins: Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase-1, MAP kinase p38 alpha and Adenosine A2a receptor. The comparative molecular docking analysis reveals that MAP kinase p38 alpha (PDB code: 3LFB) has the most binding energy – 8.07 kcal/mol in comparison to other two protein.  
Key Words: Ricobendazole, FT-IR, FT-Raman, Natural Bond Orbital, chemical reactivity.

    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" Cholesterol (Chol) is present in plasma membranes of cells of eukaryotic organism, where it regulate membranes membrane fluidity and organization of membrane phospholipids. Chol content in these membranes do not exceeds 50 mol%. Only in membranes of fiber cell plasma membranes of the eye it content exceeds this value reaching concentration as high as 66 mol% (value close to the Chol solubility threshold). At these high concentration Chol induces formation of pure Chol bilayer domains (CBDs). Here we applied atomic force microscopy (AFM) to study mechanical properties of Chol/POPC membranes with Chol/POPC molar ratio changing from 0 to 3/1. Previously, AFM was used to study mechanical properties of membranes made of several phospholipids when Chol concentration did not exceeded 50 mol% (Chol/PL molar ratio < 1/1). To ensure the compositional homogeneity throughout the membrane assembly, we used the rapid solvent exchange method for the preparation of lipid unilamellar vesicles. These vesicles were used for preparation of supported lipid membranes. The surface roughness of the membrane decreases with increase of Chol content until it reaches 60% and roughness increases with a further increase of Chol content. We use force spectroscopy to assess the mechanical property of the membrane. For membranes with the Chol content of 50 mol% or lesser, only single puncture event was observed. However, for membranes with the Chol content 50 mol% or greater, two distinct puncture events were observed. We propose that one of the puncture events corresponds to the phospholipid cholesterol domain (PCD) and the other one to the CBD. We speculate that the puncture force in the CBD is lower than that in the PCB indicating the highly dynamic and fluidic property of CBD. This result agrees with our previous EPR findings.

    <td>" Copper-cysteamine (Cu-Cy) is a new nanoparticle that can be stimulated by ultraviolet light, X-ray, microwave, and ultrasound to produce various types of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for cancer and infectious disease treatment. Our recent studies showed that Cu-Cy nanoparticles (NPs) can be used for wastewater treatment as an efficient heterogenous catalyst, thereby adding one more important practical application of this interesting material. Herein, for the first time, we describe the beginnings of a detailed investigation of the use of Cu-Cy NPs with the assistance of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidizing agent for the oxidative degradation of organic contaminants for wastewater treatment. The effects of different operating parameters, such as amount of Cu-Cy, H2O2 concentration, and dye concentration, were also investigated in detailed way to determine the optimal operating conditions. Additionally, radical scavengers on the degree of degradation of RhB were explored. Overall, it is believed that Cu-Cy/H2O2 system studied in this work could be used in advanced oxidation processes towards the degradation of organic pollutants. "

    <td>" The molecular dynamics (MD) study of protein-DNA complex system reveals the theoretical insight of inter-molecular interaction among the protein residues and DNA nucleotides. DNA binding proteins perform several biochemical interactions with DNA in living organisms. Out of these, we have studied the interaction mechanism of DNA repair protein, O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyl transferase (AGT) with methyl DNA at O6-point of guanine base during the methyl damage transfer process. Umbrella sampling method has been utilized to investigate the change in free energy of the interaction in two AGT-DNA non-covalent complexes, one with methylated GUA in DNA (system-I) and the other with methylated CYS145 in AGT (system-II). The system-I and system-II  do as pre- and post-complex structures representing the methyl damage transfer mechanism.  The estimated free energy in two complexes, clearly shows that AGT serve as the methyl damage repair agent in DNA. Our studies allow the computational investigation of DNA damage transfer mechanism and may explore future approach for its use as a target for cancer therapeutics. "

    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" α-crystallin, a significant protein of the vertebrate lens, associates to the eye lens membranes progressively with age and cataract formation. A clear understanding of α-crystallin association with the eye lens membranes, particularly involving phospholipids (PLs), remains lacking. In this study, we investigate the size of α-crystallin and its association with one-palmitoy-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) membrane by using dynamic light scattering (DLS). Phosphatidylcholine is the most abundant PL in the eye lens of short-life-span animals. Small unilamellar POPC vesicles prepared by using a rapid solvent exchange method were mixed with α-crystallin and incubated at 37 °C for 16 hours for probing the association of α-crystallin with POPC membranes. One of the key findings of this study was that with the increase in temperature, the hydrodynamic diameter of α-crystallin decreased by ~3 nm; however, there was an abrupt increase in its size above 60 °C, indicating the aggregation of α-crystallin. Also, the hydrodynamic diameter of α-crystallin at various concentrations (0.75 – 10 mg/ml) was measured. The hydrodynamic diameter remains the same (~ 26 nm) up to 5 mg/ml concentration; however, it increases at higher concentrations reaching ~28.5 nm at 10 mg/ml concentration. Moreover, α-crystallin started to aggregate above 60 °C, and the size of aggregate increased with an increase in temperature from ~60 °C to ~90 °C. However, when α-crystallin was incubated with membranes, the size of α-crystallin aggregate decreased with an increase in membrane concentration. We speculate that with an increase in membrane concentration, more and more α -crystallin binds to the membranes, preventing aggregation. It is likely that at a higher temperature, surface hydrophobicity of α -crystallin increases that enhance the binding of alpha-crystallin with membranes via hydrophobic interactions. Our results give fundamental insights into the understanding of the α-crystallin-membrane association.

    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" KCNE3 is a single transmembrane accessory protein that modulates the voltage-gated potassium ion channel, KCNQ1. KCNE3 is expressed in the colon, small intestine, specific types of cells in the stomach, and all regions of the human heart including the left and right ventricles. Studies show that mutations on this protein are linked to several diseases like Long-QT syndrome, Atrial fibrillation, Manière’s disease, Cystic fibrosis, etc. Potential association with disease amplifies the importance of understanding the structural and dynamic properties of this transmembrane protein. So far, studies have been done in micelles and isotropic bicelles which give us insight into the functioning of this protein. However, these studies have not been performed in their native membrane environments which imply the potential for limited characterization. This study seeks to probe structural and dynamic properties of the transmembrane protein KCNE3 in its native mimetic environment. To achieve this, we have optimized sample preparation for successful over expression, purification, MTSL spin labeling, and incorporation of KCNE3 into POPC/POPG liposomes and performed CW-EPR experiments. Our Circular Dichroism (CD) data suggested better folding in lipid bilayers when compared to that in micelles. Our initial CW-EPR spectral line shape analysis and molecular dynamics simulation data suggested a slower motion of the protein in lipid bilayer environment when compared to that in micelles. This is consistent with previous structural studies of KCNE3. "

    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" Lipophilic dyes such as laurdan and prodan are widely used in membrane biology due to a strong bathochromic shift in emission that reports the structural parameters of the membrane such as area per molecule. Disentangling of the factors which control the spectral shift is complicated by the stabilization of a charge-transfer-like excitation of the dye in polar environments. Predicting the emission therefore requires modeling both the relaxation of the environment and the corresponding evolution of the excited state. Here, an approach is presented in which (i) the local environment is sampled by a classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the dye and solvent, (ii) the electronically excited state of prodan upon light absorption is predicted by numerical quantum mechanics (QM), (iii) the iterative relaxation of the environment around the excited dye by MD coupled with the evolution of the excited state is performed, and (iv) the emission properties are predicted by QM. The QM steps are computed using the many-body Green’s function in the GW approximation and the Bethe–Salpeter equation with the environment modeled as fixed point charges, sampled in the MD simulation steps. The comparison to ultrafast time-resolved transient absorption measurements demonstrates that the iterative molecular mechanics (MM)/QM approach agrees quantitatively with both the polarity-dependent shift in emission and the time scale over which the charge transfer state is stabilized. Together the simulations and experimental measurements suggest that the evolution into the charge transfer state is slower in amphiphilic solvents. "

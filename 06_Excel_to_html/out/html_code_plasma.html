    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" A one dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation method has been employed to study the effect of DC voltage and ion temperature on the properties of ion-ion plasma bounded by two symmetrical but oppositely biased electrodes. It is assumed that ion-ion plasma is collisionless and both the positive and negative ion species have same mass, temperature, and degree of ionization. Simulation results show that the formation of sheath and presheath regions and fluctuation of plasma parameters in that region are affected by the biasing voltage and ion temperature. It is found that the magnitude of electrostatic electric field at the vicinity of biasing electrodes is affected by the biasing voltage and ion temperature as well. This strong electric field close to the electrodes further prevents the flow of charged particles towards the electrodes. The presence of non-zero electric field at the quasineutral region suggests a presheath region similar to the electron-ion plasma. In the quasineutral region, the density of ions increases with the increase of biasing voltage and decreases with the increase in ion temperature of isothermal ions, respectively. Furthermore, the phase space diagrams for the ions are obtained which indicates the different regions of the plasma. The positive ions acquire negative velocity towards the negatively biased electrode and the negative ions acquire positive velocity towards the positively biased electrode. "

    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" The plasma interaction on plasma facing materials has wide range of applications such as in fusion devices, plasma diodes, surface modification of materials, sputtering and many more. A one-dimensional (1d) electrostatic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) model has been used for bounded plasma system (single-emitter plasma diode) to investigate the interaction of plasma on the collector surface. It is assumed that the plasma is collisionless and electrons and ions have cut-off Maxwellian velocity distribution at the injecting side. It is found that the ion and electron concentrations decrease toward the collector surface. The ions are accelerated towards the negative biased surface whereas the electrons are repelled from it. However, those electrons having high thermal mobility can reach the collector surface. The sharp monotonic decrease of electrostatic potential near emitter and collector regions implies the formation of plasma sheath with collector sheath thickness larger than that of emitter. It is found that the electron and ion densities are dominant near the emitter and collector surfaces, respectively. In addition, the particle reflection coefficient decreases for both molybdenum (Mo) and tungsten (W) surfaces with the increase in impact energy of ion, however, the reflection coefficient for W-surface is higher than that of Mo-surface about 34.43% in magnitude. The obtained results are compared with previous work and found to be in reasonable agreement. "

    <td>" Water is one of the fundamental component for the existence of life. It is also equally essential for the aquatic media as well as for farming activities. However not all the water available on this planet is fruitful for human consumption and for other activities. So, the purification/treatment of water is very important in our day to day life. There are various techniques for the purification of water among them the ozonation method by plasma treatment is one of the best method due to its various advantages over other traditional methods. In this  study water is treated by ozonation using Arc plasma and after treatment we observed significantly enhanced in the quality of water. This research reveals that the ammonia evel and the  arsenic level in the water is decreased significantly. Also the amount of dissolved oxygen is increased in the water after treatment. "

    <td>" The arc discharge device is built and  plasma is produced between two electrodes of materials 
such as brass, copper and iron with the help of power supply.  The Langmuir technique is used for both seeded and unseeded arc plasma to determine the plasma parameters such as electron temperature, electron density, ion density, Debye length, floating potential. The present study has been made at the atmospheric pressure. The plasma thus produced in laboratory has various applications which include gaseous discharge, plasma torch, sputtering, laser produced plasma as well as Tokamak plasma. It is likely to be used to generate economically significant amount of power from controlled thermonuclear fusion in near future as well. "

    <td>" Kinetic theory has been employed to investigate the magnetized plasma sheath structure and its characteristics in the presence of more than one species of negatively charged particles: hot electrons, cold electrons and negative ions. The cold electrons and negative ions are considered to obey the Maxwellian distribution whereas the hot electrons follow the truncated Maxwellian distribution. The kinetic Bohm sheath condition has been extended and derived for the case of more than one species of negative charged particles in which the concentration of hot electrons have crucial role to achieve the Bohm velocity. The thermal motion of hot electrons is so higher as compared to the cold electrons and negative ions that the variation of hot electrons concentration plays key role in the determination of plasma sheath parameters; particle densities, electrostatic potential, and flow of positive ions towards the wall. In order to validate the Chodura model in the kinetic trajectory simulation method based on kinetic theory, we estimate the deviation of normal component positive ions velocity from the parallel component at the presheath-sheath interface and it is found that the deviation between two components increases with the increase in obliqueness of magnetic field. Furthermore, the kinetic trajectory simulation model is compared with the fluid model, the results being qualitatively similar, although the potential is deviated by about 3.84 % in terms of magnitude at the wall.

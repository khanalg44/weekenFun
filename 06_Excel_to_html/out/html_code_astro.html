    <td>" The present paper inspects the ionospheric response in terms of Total Electron Content (TEC) during the Total Solar Eclipse of 22 July 2009. The ionospheric behaviour was investigated through the changes in TEC by using the data archived at BRN2, RMTE, DNGD, NPGJ, and TPLJ Global Positioning System (GPS) stations. Our study is based on GPS-TEC measurements from a widely distributed GPS network over different geographical location of Nepal by taking July 17-21 as pre-event, July 22 as a main-event and July 23-27 as a post-event and its comparison with International Reference Ionosphere (IRI-2016) model to reveal the potential of IRI model in special events like solar eclipse with storm effect. The total solar eclipse of July 22, 2009, was totally visible from BRN2 and RMTE stations and partially visible from DNGD, NPGJ, and TPLJ stations. The result reveals that the amount of reduction in TEC is proportional to the magnitude of the total solar eclipse. The latitude also depends on the magnitude of the solar eclipse but the longitude doesn’t depend on it. The latitude is obtained to be directly proportional to the effect of the solar eclipse while longitude shows the inverse effect. TEC depletion up to 5% from pre-event to main-event and enhancement up to 30% from main-event to post-event were observed during the totality of the eclipse.The eclipse was followed by the geomagnetic storm all over Nepal which lasted for 10 hours which was the reason for the enhancement of TEC up to 50% in the main-event day from pre-event and post-event. It was also found that the IRI-2016 model underestimates the GPS-TEC and doesn’t seem to be effective for a particular event.

    <td>" Interstellar space is not empty, but contains gaseous and particulate matter that is concentrated into very large region known as interstellar clouds. The presence of dust in the interstellar medium of galaxy dramatically affects their spectral appearance and interpretation of their underlying properties. The main evidence for interstellar gas rests on spectroscopy. The atoms, ions and molecules in the interstellar gas may emit or absorb radiation corresponding to transition between their various energy levels. The information carried by the electromagnetic spectrum may arises either in the formation of spectral lines, that is, in absorption or emission over a relatively narrow band of frequency, or in continuous emission or absorption over wide band of frequencies. Infrared radiation can be very beneficial for understanding structure of different chemical group that are present in molecules. This work investigates and presents electronic, structural and spectroscopic properties of carbon chained molecules and their isomers found in interstellar dust. Density functional theory as implemented in Gaussian 09 suites of program is used to get uv-vis spectroscopy, vibrational properties, electronic and structural properties of the carbon chained molecules in the interstellar dust.

    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" A satellite is stable when it lies between the host planet’s Hill sphere and Roche limit. Hill sphere approximates the farthest gravitational influence a planet can have on its moons. If an object is gravitationally perturbed and pushed outside of this sphere, it will escape the orbit. Roche limit is the minimum distance from a center of a planet that a satellite can maintain stable orbits. Below this limit, the orbit decays and the satellite spirals into the host planet. In this work, we have determined orbital parameters that yield stable orbits for two hypothetical exomoons around a Jupiter-type exoplanet called Laliguras (HD-100777b) around the host star, Sagarmatha (HD-100777). We considered the mass of the exomoons to be equal to mass of Earth and mass of Moon.  For each set of the exomoon’s parameters, we plotted the Mean Exponential Growth for Nearby Orbits (MEGNO) maps to determine the range of exomoon’s periodic, aperiodic and quasi-periodic regions. Then, by selecting few points in these phase space maps, a direct orbital simulation is performed (for up to 50 Myr) to generate time series plots of the exomoons’ semimajor axis, eccentricity and other Keplerian elements. These time series plots are further analyzed to study the dynamics of the exomoons in 2-D and 3-D planes. "

    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" On 26th December 2019, during morning hours, an annular solar eclipse having a magnitude of 0.96 with a 118km wide antumbra occurred and lasted for 3 minutes and 40 seconds at the point of maximum eclipse. The partial eclipse was visible in most of Asia, parts of North/East Africa, and North/West Australia. The partial eclipse began at 08:14 LT (02:29 UT) and reached the full eclipse stage at 09:19 LT (03:34 UT) and then moved to the maximum eclipse position at 11:02 LT (05:17 UT). In the context of Nepal, only the partial eclipse was visible from ~ 8:34 LT (2:51 UT) and ended at ~ 11:40 LT (05:55 UT). It was 2 hours 47 mins and 54 secs long with the maximum visible eclipse time at ~ 10:01 LT (04:16 UT). Our study is based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements from a widely distributed Global Positioning System (GPS) network over different places of Nepal on the day of the eclipse, 5 days before and after the eclipse. We investigated the ionospheric behavior through the changes in Total Electron Content (TEC) during the partial eclipse over by using the data archived at the five different GPS stations of Nepal, viz. BRN2, TPLJ, RMTE, DNGD, and KKN4. The result reveals that there is significant depletion of TEC, in some cases greater than 20% compared to other normal days. Observing the values of TEC before, during, and after the event, our study showed an apparent variation during the time of the eclipse, which agrees with previous studies on ionospheric responses to the eclipse as well as theoretical assumptions.

    <td>" Solar radio bursts are the electromagnetic radio waves emitted by the accelerated non-thermal electrons during the solar eruption and they are always associated with solar active regions. These bursts are started almost at the time of a flare over a wide range of frequencies. This study is an attempt to understand the coronal activities at different height range through type II solar dynamic radio spectrum observations at low frequencies 45-445 MHz range by using Compound Astronomical Low-cost Low-frequency Instrument for Spectroscopy in Transportable Observatories (CALLISTO) network at Ooty e-CALLISTO station from 01 January 2011 to 31 December 2014. We have reported a set of 38 type II radio bursts during our observational period. All these radio bursts are found to be associated with flares and Coronal mass ejection (CME). The statistical analysis of the relationship between type II radio burst appearing in metric - decametric wavelength range is carried out. Further, we have estimated the CME height and initial acceleration of the CME using the kinematic equation. For density approximation, we have used the Newkirk model and for CME height approximation we have used the flare onset method. At the onset time of the flare, CME is assumed to be launched at least from the height of 1.25 Rʘ. With this approximation, we have reported that the estimated CME height at the time of type II initiation lies between 1.25 to 1.75 Rʘ. Our result indicates that the location of type II burst is in front of the leading edge of the CME and type II bursts are likely due to MHD shock driven by CMEs.

    <td>" Ionosphere is a part of upper atmosphere where there are enough electrons and ions which effectively interact with terrestrial and extra-terrestrial events. In this study, we analyzed pre-earthquake ionospheric anomalies that occurred before two Mexico earthquakes on 8th of September 2017 (15.02oN,  93.81oW) at 04:49 UT with magnitude 8.1 and on 19th of September 2017 (15.03oN, 98.81oW) at 18:14 UT with magnitude 7.1 .Anomalies are investigated using total electron content (TEC) from global positing system (GPS) from (OXUM) station (14.88 N,  93.17 W) near  the epicenter. First, we analyzed sigma line perturbation and then we analyzed the terminator times and their individual difference. We also analyzed trends, dispersion and night time fluctuation which gave us a possible precursor of the Mexico earthquake. Moreover, we filtered the possible effects due to lightning, magnetic storms and solar parameters if any. We found ionospheric perturbations in these parameters on 1st, 4th, 7th and 13th of September, few days prior from both Earthquakes illustrating the possibility of precursor of earthquakes.

    <td>" The low-latitude ionosphere is characterized by large-scale instabilities in the post-sunset hours due to the distinct geometry of the earth’s magnetic field lines at the equator. The magnetic field lines are horizontal at the equator contributing to the high vertical drift velocity of the plasma bubbles growing from the bottomside of the ionospheric F-region. The phenomenon, commonly known as equatorial spread F, is an important problem in aeronomy as it can cause radio wave scintillation effects representing the most critical impacts of space weather on man-made technologies, such as satellite communications and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Here, we seek to characterize the spatial distribution of equatorial ionospheric irregularities and try to understand the dependence of the peak heights of the irregularities at the magnetic equator, also called as apex-altitude, on solar flux by analyzing in-situ observations made on-board the Communications/Navigations Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) satellite mission. Since the irregularities map along the magnetic field lines, their height above the magnetic equator determines the spatial extent of the irregularities in latitude allowing us to identify regions affected by space weather impacts. In this investigation, we seek to understand the possible dependence of the irregularity parameter characterizing the equatorial ionospheric irregularities on the background ionospheric density. This is a critical examination of the irregularity parameter to confirm our results on the peak-height distributions of the irregularities at the magnetic equator and also several other studies which have employed similar definition of the irregularity parameter.

    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" Hot and ionized plasma coming out from the center of active galactic nuclei is termed as warm absorbers. Absorption lines and edges in UV and X-ray of AGN warm absorbers have been studied over long period of time. However, fundamental properties of warm absorbers like: What is the mechanism which drives the outflow? What is the gas density in the flow and the geometrical distribution of the outflow? Where does the outflow originate and what is its fate? Do ionized outflows play an important role on the host galaxy chemical history and evolution? are not determined precisely and are of great interest. 

Intrinsic UV and X-ray absorbers show large global covering factors of the central continuum source. Blue shifted absorption lines in the spectra reveal the presence of massive outflows of ionized gas from their nuclei at speed of ∼ 1000 Km/s. Which potentially can reach to ISM and can have impact on the chemical evolution and star formation process in the host galaxy. This could even reach to intergalactic medium and enrich it with heavier elements called the feedback mechanism. The resulting mass outflow rate can be a substantial fraction of the accretion rate required to power the AGN. Thus, WA can be dynamically important and the knowledge of their state, location, geometry and dynamics would help in understanding the central engines of AGN. 

Progress towards understanding warm absorbers is limited by the assumption used so far in photoionization modeling: that the gas is in ionization and excitation equilibrium. This is almost certainly not correct in detail; the dynamical timescales in the flow are comparable to or less than the timescales characterizing the ionization and excitation, and the inverse processes in the gas responsible for the lines we observe. Which means the gas departs from equilibrium and so temporal dependency for ionization, heating & cooling and radiative transfer equation has to be included in the modeling of the absorber. The ongoing research is about inclusion of time dependence in the photoionization code XSTAR, which has already been developed. The goal is to do this in a way which is as general and computationally efficient as possible. Then we will use this code for self-consistent calculations of warm absorber dynamics.

Continuous wavelets transform and cross correlation analysis has been used to study the characteristics effect of storms on different stations. Both analyses able to identify the common features that are the change in the magnitude of X-component of geomagnetic field is highest at the high latitude. The physical mechanism for these results may be related to different physical processes involved during solar-wind-geomagnetic coupling, which influence the large time scale variation that can be used as local parameters for the intensification of the intensity of a magnetic storm on the ground.

    <td>" Asymptotic giant branch stars develop into a broad coherent field of research in the
last quarter of the preceding century, but its rates go deeper into past and involve
several discoveries. AGB stars are the main dust distributors of dust into interstel-
lar medium due to their high mass loss rates in combination with an effective dust
condensation. We worked out on Infrared Astronomical satellite (IRAS) survey
using Skyview Virtual Observatory of the AGB star named IRAS 01142+6306 i.e
0
00
C-rich star, which is located at RA 01 h 17 m 33.43 s and Dec. +63 ◦ 22 2.34 . By
using virtual telescope (SkyView Observatory), we obtained the Flexible Image
Transport System (FITS) of this AGB star in IRIS and AKARI all sky survey.
We studied the physical properties like temperature mass and variation of spectral
density along major and minor diameter in 60 μm and 100 μm in IRIS and 90 μm
and 140 μm in AKARI survey. The size of the cavity is found to be 31.95 pc for
IRIS survey and 14.21 pc in case of AKARI survey. We have obtained the average
temperature 23.46 K in IRIS survey and 15.03 K in AKARI survey. The minimum
and maximum mass is found to be 4.48×10 27 kg and 6.61×10 27 kg in case of IRIS
survey and 6.30×10 28 kg and 10.13×10 28 kg in case of AKARI survey. The average
value of dust mass is found to be 6.01×10 27 kg (3.02×10 −3 M ) in IRIS survey and
8.36×10 28 kg (4.2×10 −2 M ) in case of AKARI survey. Temperature is higher near
the central region in both survey and mass is distributed along the outer arm. In
both survey dust color temperature and dust mass distribution show a very good
agreement with Gaussian. Contour plot of dust color temperature and dust mass
shows inverse relation between them. The inclination angle of the region are found
to be 77.60 ◦ in IRIS survey and 84.56 ◦ in AKARI survey. Planck function is uni-
form along the contraction (minor diameter) and non-uniform along the extension
(major diameter) in both survey. "

    <td>" In this companion paper, we are determining the Sunrise and Sunset time in Nepal’s specific Latitude and Longitude. Times of Sunrise and Sunset at specific locations have significant influences on daily life. The change of slopes and terrain at sunrise and sunset affect temperature, air density, and wind. The times of Sunrise, Sunset, and Twilight at any particular location depend on factors such as latitude, longitude, time of year, elevation angle, and heights of the surrounding terrain. Earth orbits the Sun in an elliptic path. To formulate the Sunrise and Sunset times, we need to calculate the Solar elevation angle and time of meridian passage. Then, by substituting values of latitude, longitude, and altitude in the formulae, the required times are generated. During the Earth’s orbital period, the light prevails in the part of the Earth that faces the Sun. This period is called day and the part which remains on the opposite side of the Sun blocking all the light is called night. In this talk, I will present all the orbital phenomena that lead to Sunrise and Sunset and a specific way to calculate these times. The result of my calculations is found to be in good agreement with the other investigations.

    <td>" Ionospheric total electron content (TEC) variations prior  and after to the great Gorkha Earthquake in Nepal (Mw = 7.8) in April 25, 2015 were analyzed using measurements from widely distributed Global Positioning System (GPS) network.This study has been performed to understand the relationship between ionospheric TEC anomalies and earthquake occurrences. The analysis of vertical TEC (VTEC) time series from different GPS stations shows that the abnormal TEC variations appeared few days up to a few hours before the events lasting up to 8 h. Moreover, the pre-earthquake ionospheric anomalies were also observed in the geomagnetically conjugated region. In view of the solar-terrestrial environment, the pre-earthquake ionospheric anomalies could be associated with the Nepal earthquake. The results also illustrate that TEC variation is dominant near the earthquake epicenter. "

    <td>" The calculation for mass of elliptical galaxies is little different than other galaxies. The rotational velocity in elliptical galaxies is not possible since it does not rotate in a systematic way to observe the wavelength shifts produced by the Doppler effect of either stars or gas. But, if the various speeds within this galaxy cluster are known to us then we could calculate the mass the galaxy must contain in order to hold the star within it. We have taken Messier 87 as our sample for the elliptical galaxy as it is also the most massive galaxy in this observable universe. We fetched the spectrum of M87 from British Astronomical Association Database. By obtaining and analyzing the spectrum, we can determine a wealth of characteristics for that object. Our research will be focused on determining a) enrichment of chemical abundance and its proportion in the interstellar dust of M87 b) at which rate M87 is moving away from us i.e. redshift. c) distance to the galaxy d) the average velocity of the stars within this galaxy cluster i.e. velocity dispersion e) how massive it is, using virial theorem in the case of elliptical galaxies  ( Poveda’s relation). Here, we have done the required calculation using python programming. Here, we will be reviewing the spectrum especially in the optical region. "

    <td>" This paper reports the variation of total ozone column (TOC) over Jumla (Lat.:29.28o N, Long.:82.16o E and Alt.:2300 m above sea level) from 2008 to 2014 derived from Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) satellite observations. The trends of monthly, seasonal and annual variations of TOC, solar isolation and clearness index have been analyzed. The result exemplifies that during the whole study period, the maximum value of monthly average TOC is 289.21 ± 10.75 DU in April, while the minimum value is 257.23 ± 11.25 DU on December. The results also show that TOC is highly seasonal dependent with larger TOC in Spring 273.68 ± 14.92 DU and lower in winter season(260.68 ± 15.25 DU). The average annual value of TOC exhibits slightly variable with a maximum in 2010 (277.52 ± 40.64 DU) and minimum in 2008 (267.19 ± 11.11 DU). The average values of solar isolation and clearness index for whole study period are 5.10 ± 0.86 kWh/m2/day and 0.59 ± 0.12 respectively. The average value of TOC during the whole study period is 271.84 ± 14.19 DU, which indicates good amount of stratospheric ozone content over Jumla, Nepal

    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" Tidal Dwarf Galaxies (TDGs) are interesting objects presently forming from gas which has been expelled from their parent galaxies during an interaction. We performed spectroscopic analysis of tidal dwarf galaxies Id08092137 of size 14.59 × 10.88 arcsec at RA: 122.4474, DEC: 21.6215 with redshift value 0.0111; and Id15182205 of size 9.46 × 8.74 arcsec  at RA: 229.6666, DEC: 22.0863 with redshift value 0.0158 chosen from a catalog of Paudel et al. 2018. The SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) DR14 spectra of these galaxies are studied and identiﬁed their characteristic peaks. The star formation rates in these galaxies are calculated using the method of Kennicutt et al. 1998. The star formation rate in the galaxies Id08092137 and Id15182205 are found to be 0.02321 M☉yr-1 and 0.05221 M☉yr-1 respectively. In addition, photometric analysis of these galaxies was performed in order to study overall flux in different bands, size of the structure, and flux density variation along major and minor diameters of the structure in different bands of SDSS.

    <td>" This paper will give you an overview of one of the flagship program of Nepal Astronomical Society (NASO) which has been running in Nepal since 2016. All-Nepal Asteroid Search Campaign was designed in collaboration with International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC), USA. The program promote citizen science in asteroid search and provides opportunity to students and teachers from Nepal to discover and name asteroids. Until April 2020, Nepal has 7 provisional discoveries which will be named in 5-6 years by them. The discoveries have already been list in IAU Minor Planet Center database.

The program is free to all interested students and team are on selective basis. In order to help students and teachers to understand the process of Astronomical Search, Astrometry, Digital Sky Survey, we started monthly training program for interested individuals at nominal cost. The fund raised through such training will go to run outreach activities of NASO. "

    <td>" We study if NGC7293 is an active Star-forming region or not in a comparative manner by using IRIS and AKARI all-sky map. Our selection is a nebular structure at galactic longitude 337.410 degrees and latitude -20.840 degrees at a distance of 200.97pc, 0.5 × 0.5 degrees IRIS, and 0.4 × 0.4 degrees AKARI map of NGC7293 is downloaded from sky view virtual observatory and then processed in the software ALADIN v2.50. The minimum and maximum temperatures from AKARI all-sky map are found to be 19.90 K and 37.46 K respectively. Also, the average temperature via slope of linear plot in the flux is found to be 22.25 K. Similarly, the minimum and maximum temperatures from IRIS all-sky map are found to be 23.99 K and 24.82 K respectively and the average temperature via slope of linear plot in the flux is also found to be 31.38 K. The total mass of the structure is found to be 3.04×1028 kg and 6.46 ×1026 Kg in AKARI and IRIS images. The flux density variation along the major and minor diameters showed a Gaussian-like distribution, suggesting local thermodynamical equilibrium in the isolated structure. The Jeans mass of the dust in the NGC7293 nebular structure in AKARI image is found to 2.29×1033 kg, and in IRIS image is found to be 4.41×1033 kg which is much greater than the total mass, so we have concluded that the structure is not a star-forming region and is in local thermodynamic equilibrium.

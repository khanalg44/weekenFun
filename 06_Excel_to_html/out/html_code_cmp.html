    <td>" STUDY THE MECHANOCHEMISTRY OF SILICON CARBIDE NANORIBBON (SiCNRs) BY USING FIRST PRINCIPLE

 

Mechanochemistry deals with the behavior of molecule under applied stress. Constrained Geometries Simulate External Forces method is used in order to study the behavior of Silicon Carbide Nanoribbon (SiCNR) to find their behavior under external stress. This approach is based on the scan of potential energy due to change in nanoribbon geometry. Thus, applied stress is the negative gradient of change in energy. A hybrid density functional B3LYP as implemented in Gaussian09 suites of program is used for energy scan of the nanoribbon under study. Method comprise constrained geometry optimization of the stretched nanoribbon along with their energy scan. The change in successive energies along with their change in length helps in determining the externally applied force. Finally this work calculates their Young modulus and force-extension curves. The study also includes some fundamental electronic properties that undergoes in nanosystem with the application of external force. "

There is no any chemical bonding between the water molecules and the guest molecules but they are connected by hydrogen bonding. they are ice like compounds and typically form under high pressure and low temperature in permafrost region and shallow marine environment such as in seabed sediments along continental margin. Methane hydrate is an example of gas hydrate in which methane gas acts as guest.The energy stored in methane hydrate reserves is twice more than the energy in the reserves of other hydrocarbon sources. As methane is also a greenhouse gas and it is difficult to utilize it properly. Even a small quantity of methane gas would cause severe effect in environment. The electronic properties of methane hydrate analogous with ice. This is true because the amount of water in hydrate structure is high. The electronic properties of methane hydrate such as the HOMO-LUMO gap, bond length, electron transfer, B.E. per atom and charge distribution, are derived using a functional B3LYP of DFT. Many properties of methane hydrate are almost identical to the properties of ice, and both ice and methane hydrate do not appear to be good conductors of electricity whereas their properties seem to be bad conductors.

We explain this theoretically using the Maxwell-Garnett (MG) mixing for the dielectric responses of planar periodic arrays of identical SWCNTs. We start with the calculation of the conductivity of an individual SWCNT using the k.p method. Then we derive a semi-analytical expression for the dielectric tensor of an ultrathin finite-thickness periodically aligned SWCNT array. The dielectric responses of about a dozen of SWCNT arrays with different chiralities and very close diameters are then mixed using the MG method to obtain the dielectric response of the SWCNT film which explains the experimental ellipsometry measurements. We also note that the inhomogeneously broadened interband plasmon resonance overlaps with the broadened exciton resonance, making the exciton-plasmon coupling and associated photon bandgap formation possible in these systems.

There are two pressure acting in the metal surface that reduces the work function much lower such that sound wave can have to full fill the soundelectric effect with the positive kinetic energy of ejected electron. These two are external pressure and pressure created by particle vibration of sound wave both acting inward pressure. We found that inward pressure and outward pressure (due to shielding effect), results two outermost orbits come very closer that reduces the energy gap between two orbits. Due to low work function of material in this way one can eject the electron from sound energy instead of light energy like Einstein photoelectric effect. Thus, it helps to increase the efficiency of converting sound energy to electricity in a large scale by using piezo material (transducer) in highly populated roads or stadium or railway stations etc. "

    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" An ordinary Hall effect in a conductor arises due to the Lorentz force acting on the charge carriers. In ferromagnets, an additional contribution to the Hall effect, the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), appears proportional to the magnetization. It is also known that the AHE can arise in non-collinear and non-coplanar antiferromagnets due to scalar spin chirality. While the AHE itself bears the potential of application in electronic devices such as Hall sensors, quantization of the AHE can lead to exotic phenomena with potential for dissipationless electronics and quantum computing. Recently, a large AHE was observed in a collinear antiferromagnet CoNb3S6 [1]. The subsequent theories have indicated that the AHE in CoNb3S6 may be inherently related to the chirality associated with the crystal structure, a new mechanism for the anomalous Hall effect. Our recent experiment, however, suggests that the AHE is intrinsically related to the electronic band structure. In this talk I will present our recent results in which we have been able to tune the AHE by hole doping obtained in Co1-xFexNb3S6 samples. I will then discuss the importance of these results, which together with other recent related experimental findings [2] in CoNb3S6, suggest that quantization of the AHE can be achieved in CoNb3S6 by band tuning through optimal doping.

The surfaces of a 3D TI are composed of massless Dirac cone which is characterized by the Z2 topological invariant. Introduction of magnetism on the surface of TI is essential to realize the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) and other novel magneto-electric phenomena. Here, by using a combination of first-principles calculations, magneto-transport, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and time resolved ARPES (tr-ARPES), we study Gd (4f )-doped Sb2Te3. Our study shows that Gd doped Sb2Te3 is a spin-orbit-induced bulk band-gap magnetic material, whose surface is characterized by a single topological Dirac cone. We further demonstrate that introducing diluted 4f-electron

To illuminate the underlying physics driving the formation of these novel phases, we have carried out inelastic neutron scattering measurements of GaV4S8 above and below the ordering temperature of 12.7 K. Dispersive spin excitations with zone boundary energy 5.7 meV are observed along [100], [110] directions within the magnetically ordered phase. Using a Heisenberg model with nearest neighbor exchange couplings and symmetry protected Dzyaloshinskii-Moria interactions, excitation spectra are simulated. Simulation shows ferromagnetic inter-tetrahedral couplings with J = -0.69(3) meV. The modeling of spin excitation indicates the existence of weak DM interaction in the ground state at 2 K. The finding of the interaction parameters in GaV4S8 provides an important information about the magnetic ground state in GaV4S8. "

Abstract
The study of Structure, Electronic and Magnetic properties of 2D heterostructure (HS) materials Graphene-Molybdenum diSulphide (G-MoS2) with vacancy defects at C sites have been done by executing first-principles calculations, performed within the framework of Density Functional Theory (DFT) under the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form of the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA). The ven der Waals (vdW) interactions have been carried out into account (considered via Grimmeâs model) by DFT-D2 approach. The (HS) G-MoS2 without and with C sites vacancy defects have been optimized using BFGS methods implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO package. These optimized geometries have been used to investigate the Electronic and Magnetic properties of pure and C sites vacancy defects (HS) G-MoS2 from the band structure calculations and DOS-PDOS analysis. By analyzing the calculations, we acquired that the pure (HS) G-MoS2 are metallic in nature and can be useful for low power consumption electronic devices, but C sites vacancy defects (HS) G-MoS2 materials have energy gap. From the band structures calculation, we found that Fermi energy level shifted towards the conduction band in vacancy defects geometries revels n-type Schottky defects. The analysis of the magnetic properties show that the non-magnetic pure (HS) G-MoS2 changes to magnetic materials by C sites vacancy defects. It is also found that total magnetism of  R-1C, L-1C, C-1C and 2C atoms vacancy defects have values -0.47ÂµB/cell, -0.43ÂµB/cell, -0.12ÂµB/cell and +0.14ÂµB/cell respectively and spins of 2s, 2p orbitals of C atoms have main contributions to the magnetism in all these configurations.

    <td>" Quasicrystals differ from conventional crystals by possessing long--range order without periodicity.  Quasicrystalline phases have been observed not only in metallic alloys [1] but also in liquid crystals, polymers, colloids, perovskites and overlayer structures of single elements and molecules. All of these quasicrystalline phases exhibit orders of rotational symmetry which are forbidden in periodic crystals, such as 5--, 10--, and 12--fold, and their structures are associated with complex aperiodic tilings  such as Penrose tilings. This talk will present the first experimental observation of a 4-fold quasicrystalline structure in a physical system. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) shows that fullerenes (C60) deposited on the surface of an icosahedral Al--Pd--Mn quasicrystal selectively adsorb atop specific atomic species, forming a Fibonacci square grid [2] (figure 1). The relative simplicity of such a model system provides an avenue to understanding the unusual properties of quasicrystals with higher order rotational symmetries. This site specific adsorption behaviour offers the potential to create tuneable structures in molecular overlayers, such as array of molecular magnets. The findings also demonstrate that molecules can be used as a chemical probe to identify atomic species on metallic alloy surfaces, a key step in understanding the surface structure of complex systems like quasicrystals. We will also discuss other unique structures of overlayer grown on quasicrystals [3, 4].

The required energies for doping of gallium ion on germanium, in order to obtain maximum damage at 600 Ã, were calculated using SRIM; Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter. These energies when implanted independently on germanium causes the production of germanium recoils, vacancy-interstitial pairs, and phonons during the collision process. For 130.000 keV gallium ion, the energy used for ionization, phonon production and vacancies creation are 37.713 keV (29.01% of incident energy), 90.006 keV (64.29% of incident energy) and 8.710 keV (6.7% of incident energy) respectively. The amount of target displacement, replacement collisions and vacancies were also evaluated. Doping of gallium ions on germanium also reveals that the energy loss due to nuclear stopping was greater than electronic stopping.

    <td>" Single crystal hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an ultrawide (~ 6.0 eV) semiconductor that has potential applications for developing electronic, optoelectronic and nanophotonic devices including source of ultraviolet emitters. A key issue in these applications is understanding the effect of impurities, especially carbon and oxygen, on its properties. Here the properties and compositions of h-BN and oxidized h-BN were compared. Fourth harmonic laser (195 nm) generated from the Ti: sapphire laser was used for optical excitation in the experiments. The luminescence properties are investigated by annealing the samples at different temperatures under different conditions. The deep UV photoluminescence spectra from h-BN samples annealed at 700 oC in ambient air reveals a strong phonon-assisted band-edge emissions along with a sharp atomic-like emission line at 4.09 eV, and its phonon replicas at 3.89 and 3.69 eV. In addition to these peaks, PL spectrum of powder sample also shows some sharp multi-phonon peaks, adjacent to them. The broadening of these main peaks occurs as the annealing temperature exceeds 900 ÂºC. We will present our findings of atomic-like features that could have potential applications as quantum sources in UV regions for quantum information technologies.  "

The band structure and DoS calculation shows the existence of an energy gap by 0.13 eV in its minority spin channel and hence half metallic character.

    <td>" The transition metal oxides (TMOs) heterostructures in their nanodimensions exhibit very rich and promising novel physical and chemical behaviors for scientific research and technological innovation. The investigations of electronic and atomic reconstructions of pristine LaVO3 and CaVO3 have revealed that the former one is the Mott-insulator whereas the latter one is the correlated metal.
We have implemented the interfacial electrostatic bonds to investigate the possible growth of complex TMOs heterostructures of nearly infinite stable chemical combinations. With this vast possibility for tuning and combining properties, we can achieve various desirable change of many currently used electronic, optical and energy devices. 
The effect of different levels of filling controls on electronic structure and transport properties of heterostructure of supperlattices of LaVO3 and CaVO3 are studied by using the first-principle method with GGA approximation of WIEN2k frameworks. A patching software, BoltzTrap 1.5 is used for predicting the transport behaviours, such as electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, transport coefficient, magnetic susceptibility etc. are observed for different levels of filling control.
Furthermore, the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) is implemented for realistic calculation of electronic structure of the materials. The spectral density of Matsubara frequency, which corresponds to density of states (DOS) for the system is investigated using the Maximum Entropy data analysis method for the resulting DMFT data obtained with ALPS-package and ABINIT package. The characteristics of spectral density of LaVO3 with U=5.0eV reveals that LaVO3 is the Mott-insulator. The result is consistent with the experimental observation of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).

Abstract
Electronic and magnetic properties of quaternary Heusler alloys RhZrTiIn and  RhZrTiAl   have been studied by using density functional theory (DFT) based Wien2k approach. The optimized structure of RhZrTiIn and RhZrTiAl are obtained through the energy minimization process. From the study, the quaternary Heusler alloys RhZrTiIn and RhZrTiAl shows half-metallic ferromagnetic and  spin-polarized density of states (DOS). The spin dependent band gap, that is, Half- metallic gap of RhZrTiIn and RhZrTiAl are found to be 0.27626 eV and 0.22267 eV respectively . We have obtained unsymmetrical nature of DOS in up and down spin channels. The magnetic moments of RhZrTiIn and RhZrTiAl  are found to be 2.00057 ÂµB and 2.00009 ÂµB respectively which are integral values supporting HMF nature of RhZrTiIn and RhZrTiAl. The effects of uniform strain have been investigated within GGA, GGA+mBJ and GGA+U methods. Detailed study of quaternary Heusler alloys RhZrTiIn and RhZrTiAl will be comprehensibly presented.

    <td>" It has been well known that interplay between topology and magnetism in topological materials can give rise to various magnetic topological states. The study of the topological materials with intrinsic magnetism is thus very desirable. Here, using the high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) combined with the first-principles calculations, we report a systematic study on the electronic band topology across the magnetic phase transition in EuIn2As2 which possesses an antiferromagnetic ground state below 16 K. Antiferromagnetic EuIn2As2 has been predicted to host both the Axion insulator and higher order topological insulator (HOTI) phase. Our experimental results show the clear signature of the evolution of the topological state across the magnetic transition. Our theoretical calculation of the parity invariant Z4 topological invariant indicates the axion insulating phase (Z4 = 2). Our study  thus provides a platform to  further study the interplay of topological and magnetism in this material. "

To understand the working mechanics of drugs, the knowledge of the transport properties, estimation of free energy of solvation etc. of drugs in aqueous medium can play a significant role. We can also estimate the solubility of drugs from the free energy of solvation. In this work, we have performed the classical molecular dynamics simulations of a system containing binary mixture of amoxicillin and SPC/E water molecules at different temperature. The self diffusion coefficients of both the solute as well as solvent have been estimated from graph of mean squared displacement (MSD) as a function of time; and their binary diffusion coefficient using Darken's relation at temperature 293 K, 298 K, 303 K, 305 K, 310 K and 313 K. Also, the free energy of solvation of amoxicillin in water has been estimated at 310K from free energy perturbation method. The calculated values of self diffusion coefficient for solvent are in close agreement with previously reported values. "

The zero-gap (gapless) semiconductor in Heusler alloy have created a much interest, because of their extraordinary electronic property. These gapless materials have numerous practical applications in electronic devices, such as photo detector, photo generator, electromagnetic sensor and so on. Moreover, the gapless semiconductor with magnetism could have wide application in novel spintronic devices. The gapless property is observed in Co-Mn based quaternary Heusler alloy CoMnVAl employing first-principles calculations through density functional theory (DFT) based on Tight Binding Linear Muffin-Tin Orbital within Atomic Sphere Approximation (TB-LMTO-ASA) with local density approximation (LDA) and exchange correlation.
We here observed density of state(DOS) and band structure of optimized CoMnVAl. The structure of CoMnVAl is found to be FCC with lattice parameters 5.66 A 0 (10.68 a. u.), which fairly agree with experimental value 5.80 A 0 (10.95 a. u.) [1]. From the spin polarized band structure and DOS, CoMnVAl is found to have zero-gap energy bands of indirect type at Fermi level. Which is in clear agreement with the previously calculated theoretical and experimental results [2]. The highest energy gap between valance band (VB) at L point and conduction band (CB) at the same point implies that the highest energy is required when an electron hole pair is created by transferring the electron from VB to CB at the same point L. While, the lowest (zero) value of indirect gap between CB and VB respectively at X and G designate the smallest energy required for electron hole pair at these points. By the analysis of fat band and partial DOS, the major contribution to energy bands and DOS near Fermi
level is found from d orbital electron of cobalt (Co), manganese (Mn) and vanadium (V) and little from s and p orbital electron of aluminum (Al). The symmetric nature of DOS in majority and minority spin channel reveals that there is no magnetic moment either in parent CoMnVAl or in individual atomic cite. The absence of magnetic moment in 24 valance electron quaternary Heusler alloy CoMnVAl strongly support the Slater Pauling rule [3] . Finally, the complex type of bonding (i. e. mixture of covalent, metallic and some how ionic) is ascertained between atoms in CoMnVAl.

    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" We investigate bining energy, band structure and density of states of  different morphologies of CuO as nanocluster, nanotube, nanoribbon, nanosheet and bulk. We apply exchange correlation functional SGGA+U in Density Functional Theory (DFT) based Ab-initio Approach for the investigations of their structural st abilities and analyzed magnetic moments. They are optimized and analyzed before their calculations. We observe the antiferromagnetic and p-type semiconducting behavior with band gap 2.22 eV in bulk where as the n-type semiconducting behavior with band gap 2.2 eV in chiral (2,1) CuO nanotube but half metallic ferromagnetic feature in chiral (3,1) CuO nanotube . The other forms as cluster, zigzag (7,0) and armchair (7,7) in nanoribbon, and zigzag (7,0) and armchair (7,7) in nanosheet show metallic and ferromagnetic behaviors respectively. The structural stability conformed through their binding energy  estimations. The magnetic behavior is found by the calculations of magnetic moment and spin polarization. The magnetic moments of half metallic clusture (CuO)4, half metallic chiral (3,1) nanotube, full metallic zigzag (7,0) and armchair (7,7) nanoribbons, and half metallic zigzag (7,0) and armchair (7,7) nanosheets are 0.03, 0.66, 0.41, 0.84, 0.76, and 1.29 mB respectively. They may be applied in applications as battery, solar cell, diode rectifier, storage media, sensor etc. 
 
Key words: morphologies of CuO, SGGA+U, structural stability, DOS, semiconducting, magnetic moment, metallic ferromagnetic

    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" Transition metal carbides (MXenes) are an emerging family of highly conductive two-dimensional materials with additional functional properties introduced by surface terminations. Further modification of the surface terminations makes MXenes even more appealing for practical applications. Herein, we report a facile and environmentally benign synthesis of surface-engineered Ti3C2Tx MXene (r-Ti3C2Tx) via a simple treatment with L-ascorbic acid at room temperature with enhanced quality. r-Ti3C2Tx shows a six-fold increase in the electrical conductivity, from \ 471 \pm49 for regular Ti3C2Tx to  2819\pm306 S/m for the reduced version. Additionally, we show an enhanced oxidation stability of r-Ti3C2Tx as compared to regular Ti3C2Tx. An examination of the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity reveals that the SERS enhancement factor of r-Ti3C2Tx is an order of magnitude higher than that of regular Ti3C2Tx. The improved SERS activity of r-Ti3C2Tx is attributed to the charge transfer interaction between the MXene surface and probe molecules, re-enforced by increased electronic density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level of r-Ti3C2Tx. The findings of this study suggest that reduced MXene could be a superior choice over regular MXene, especially for the applications that employ high electronic conductivity, such as electrode materials for batteries and supercapacitors, photodetectors, and SERS-based sensors.

    <td>" In our work, we investigate systematically the evolution of structural and electronic prop-
erties of graphene-like titanium carbide and nitride MXenes (Ti2N, and Ti2C) with different
functional groups (F, O, H, and OH) using density functional calculation with PEB func-
tional. We found that, the structure of pristine MXene posses same hexagonal symmetry
as parent bulk MAX phase. In case of terminated derivatives, the terminated species are
distributed randomly on surface of pristine sheet with preferred location in the sites of va-
cant space between Ti atoms in pristine sheet. In contrast of electronic properties, We found that, all the studied MXene are metallic with large conductivity except Ti2CO2, It is ex-
pected to be semiconducting. Similarly for magnetic properties, without termination it show
magnetic nature but with termination magnetism is completely destroyed. Now, currently we
are studying vacancy defect in Ti2N and Ti2C separately. "

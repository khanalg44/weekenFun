    <td>" Integer number factorization has been known to be inefficient and have exponential or by-far super-polynomial time complexity for classical computer. Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can factor a given number N in polynomial time by exploiting the correspondence of factoring problem with period finding problem on a quantum computer. Shor's algorithm specifically uses quantum Fourier transform as a key component for reducing the complexity of the problem to BQP class. This paper introduces quantum Fourier transform and  technique of Shor's algorithm using modular exponentiation. "

    <td>" The atmospheric visibility is a proven indicator of ambient air quality by proxy. The trend of visibility is less understood in our region. In this study, two cities of Nepal; Bhairahawa (27.506ºN, 83.416ºE) and Surkhet (28.6ºN, 81.617ºE) were selected. Historical climatological data from 1977 to 2020 were collected. Two well-established methods: ‘percentile analysis’ and ‘annual good/bad day percentage’ were used to investigate the trend of visibility.  Degradation of visibility in Surkhet during the 1980s was reflected from percentile analysis and minor recovery during the 2000s was observed. Visibility in Bhairahawa began a notable decline trend since the mid-80s. The decline continued and suffered poor visibility situation in recent years (good day percentage ~ 0%, bad day percentage ~ 47%). In Surkhet, marked degradation of visibility started comparatively late since 2010 when simultaneous and sharp increase in bad day percentage (1-22.5% max) and decrease in good day (36.5-0%) percentage is observed. Strong seasonality in visibility was observed in both places. Bhairahawa displayed worse visibility conditions in winter (4.7 km), as expected. In contrast, Surkhet showed the lowest visibility (16.7 km) in late summer.  These marked trends in visibility decline show invalid environmental policy despite continued emissions of pollutants. This study necessitates a macro-control of pollution emissions to effectively reduce air pollution deterioration. "

    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" Our vision is not just merely a sensation arising from visual stimuli by focusing rays of light at the retina that ultimately projected into the visual cortex and interpreted as an image by the brain. From retina to the brain, complex layers of interconnected sensory networks work together to select, organize and interpret seamlessly to produce a single experience, called perception in parallel with sight. Color, for example, is a perception that exists only inside the brain not in the world. Therefore, if the vision is lost, it is unlikely to restore its natural state, however, the major cause of blindness in humans is due to the death of photo-receptors cells only that convert light into a meaningful electrical signal. The non-photoreceptor cells and complex visual circuitry often remain largely intact. Therefore, various strategies are being developed to make other retinal cells photosensitive or interface artificially created electrical signals from a live image to the remaining visual circuitry. One of the strategies, optogenetics, uses light-sensitive microbial protein to impart photo-transduction mechanism to the surviving retinal cells thereby potentially restoring vision to the blind. "

    <td>" Edge detection and similar image analysis techniques are commonly used in computer vision but have not been fully realized for the purpose of ARPES data analysis. Without applying any Image analysis, the interpretation of ARPES data is left to the eyes of researchers and can be tricky and unreliable due to many sources of noise and distortion from the experimental processes, as a result, some of the finer, defining, details required to classify a material can be missed. By applying edge detection techniques, we are able to highlight key features such as distinct, clustered bands and other fine details that may otherwise have been obscured by noise and other experimental artefacts. Here we show the implementations of various image processing techniques applied to ARPES data and how they not only aid the interpretation of results, but can also be looked upon as stepping stones for better data processing techniques and potential automation of the classification of quantum materials through analysis of ARPES data.

    <td>" Advancing our understanding of the few-body problem is one of the important goals of atomic scattering research. It is very important to understand the relative contribution of first vs higher-order mechanisms in accurately describing the few-body dynamics. One higher-order process that is particularly important in ionization is known as post-collision interaction (PCI) where the projectile and the ejected electron interact with each other again after the primary interaction. It is well known that PCI maximizes when the ejected electron has the velocity equal to that of the projectile however, kinematically complete data were completely lacking in this region. We have performed kinematically complete experiments on ionization of H2 and He by 75 keV proton impact. The momentum analyzed scattered projectiles and recoil ions were measured in coincidence and the ejected electrons’ momenta were deduced from the conservation laws. Fully differential cross sections (FDCS) were measured for various fixed electron energies for each of the targets near the projectile-electron velocity matching region. Pronounced post-collisional effects between the projectile and the ejected electron were observed in the projectile scattering angle dependence, the electron emission angle dependence, and the electron energy dependence of the FDCS. The results were compared with two conceptually very similar calculations. Surprising differences were observed not only between experimental data and theory but also between similar theoretical models.  This shows that the FDCS are very sensitive to the details of the underlying few-body dynamics in this region. "

    <td>" Relaxor ferroelectrics were discovered in the 1950s but many of their properties were not understood. In this review, we would concentrate on ABO3 ferroelectric perovskite materials for energy storage applications. The dielectric and ferroelectric properties of these materials can be tuned for various applications such as memory devices, high energy storage, piezoelectric devices, sensors,  actuators and ultrasonic transducers etc. Some of the most research ABO3 ferroelectric is PT,  PZT, PZT-PFN, PMN, BT, BZT, BF, BZT-BCT etc. In recent years, scientists are intensively doing the research in this field and tuning their dielectric and ferroelectric properties. Vogel-Fulcher relation describes the shift of frequency towards higher temperature in T-dependent permittivity measurements in ferroelectric relaxor. The modified Curie-Weiss law explains the degree of diffuse phase transition (DPT) of materials when it surpasses the phase transition temperature (Tm), the polar nano regions (PNRs) establish which attributes the frequency dispersion. Moreover, slim P-E hysteresis loop with high spontaneous polarization and low coercive field supports relaxor behavior and one can estimate the  charging and discharging energy density of capacitors. In this presentation,  we briefly discuss on origin of random orientation of nanodomain which create relaxor behavior, and their dielectric and ferroelectric properties. In addition, tuning the relaxor properties, and different approaches of materials synthesis and results of different system, will be presented. Relaxor ferroelectric is one of the promising fields of study which could be fulfill the future demand of high energy storage capacity of devices. "

Despite recent progress in methods such as direct imaging using electron and super-resolution microscopy, and atomic force microscopy, single-molecule structure determination remains as highly challenging goals. Toward this end, we used a mechanically reconfigurable DNA Nanoswitch Caliper (DNC) capable of measuring multiple coordinates on single biomolecules with atomic resolution. Using dual-trap optical tweezers, we demonstrate absolute distance measurements of the biotin-binding sites within a single biotin-streptavidin complex with angstrom-level precision. We achieved a successful reconstruction of the tetrahedron geometrical coordinates of the biotin-binding sites in a streptavidin molecule. Additionally, we determined the relative occupancy of the biotin binding sites in a streptavidin. DNA Nanoswitch Calipers are a powerful and accessible tool for characterizing distances and geometries within nanoscale complexes that will transform the structural biology for improved diagnostics and drug discovery.

The use of ionizing radiation in medicine, energy production, industry, and research bring enormous benefits to people when it is used safely. However, the potential radiation risk must be assessed and controlled [1]. This study was done to know about the actual status of radiation protection in the hospitals and diagnostic centres in province 5 of Nepal, specially to know about the radiation leakage in different places near radiographic area. In total, 14 hospitals with diagnostic radiology facility and different radiography centres were randomly chosen for this study. Questionnaire for radiation workers were used and radiation exposures of the radiation equipment were measured with dosimeter in and outside the room. To calculate equivalent dose level H(mSv/min) we measured dose rate level in each area D(mSv/min) in an exposition at higher kV, mAs [2].

    <td>" With the tremendous progress in nanotechnology, there has been efforts to study spintronics of nanoclusters for various possible applications. Silicon Carbide, one of the best sought alternative candidates for nanocluster has unique bulk properties that added with quantum sizes effect can potentially be an alternative to carbon-only nanoclusters. Despite a huge difference between sp2 and sp3 bond structure, there has been successful synthesis of silicon carbide nanotubes. This work presents the first principle and semiempirical study on various spin states of silicon carbide nanotube. The type-1 armchair and zigzag silicon carbide nanotubes are taken for a comparative study on chirality dependence on spin-state properties of the nanotube. In particular the paper investigates various spin states of nanotubes (5,0) and (3,3) having similar diameters (5.1 and 5.3 Å respectively). The calculations suggested that the zigzag nanotubes show more magnetic nature than armchair nanotubes in all spin states, as manifested by electronic properties. The energetic and structural properties of the nanotubes such as HOMO-LUMO gap, binding energy, charge distribution also suggest a strong dependence of these properties on spin states and chirality.

    <td>" Cells based on Lithium (Li)-metal as an anode is of particular interest owing to their high energy density, and specific capacity more than ten times to that of graphite anodes. However, the notorious reactivity of Li-metal prevents their practical applications due to undesired Li dendrites growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. Here, we consider a rational approach for designing an artificial Li-metal/electrolyte interface. Facile, cost-effective, and one-step reaction mechanism of pretreating Li metal anode with an electrolyte containing SnF2 was employed for the first time. As a result, an artificial SEI composed of LiF, Sn, and Sn-Li alloy was formed. The higher ionic conductivity and Young’s modulus of an artificial layer facilitate fast Li-ion diffusion and suppress the Li dendrite growth, respectively.  An artificial SEI showed the synergistic effect of storing Li by forming reversible Sn-Li alloy and allowing Li plating underneath the SEI. Such protected Li symmetrical cells showed outstanding plating/stripping cycles with reduced overpotential compared to the bare Li. In addition, an artificial SEI protected Li anode coupled with high-loading (11.88 mg.cm-2) LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NMC111) showed remarkable results such as longer stable cycling, higher capacity at higher rates and higher rate capability compared to the bare Li anode. This approach could lead to the development of high energy density and safe Li-metal based batteries. "

We also compute the arrival times using the same model for both seismic events at respective epicenter distances 0.5962° and 0.7453° from the station. The back-azimuth for both events is computed with gps2Dist Azimuth from functions provided by obspy signal.

We found 21 arrivals for mainshocks with first p phase arriving at incident angle 76.93° in 11.706 seconds having ray parameter 1070.003 and phase SKIKSSKIKS as final arrivals in 3268.82 seconds with incident angle 0.0241° having ray parameter 0.7935. Similarly, for the largest aftershock 27 arrivals were collected with the first arrival P phase at incident angle 62.81° in 14.393 seconds having ray parameter 977.071.The final arrivals SKIKSSKIKS seismic phase incidents at 0.030° in 3267.81 seconds with ray parameter 0.9710. For major shocks there are  p, P, P phases followed by sP and then s, S, S phase at the beginning while for the largest  aftershocks  P, p, P, P phases are followed by Pn, P, sP, S, s, S, S, Sn, S. Then after sequences of PcP phase to SKIKSSKIKS phase are same for both events. From this, it can be concluded that with growing depth more and more secondary seismic body wave phases observed which tell about the geometrical and physical properties of discontinuities that they have encountered during their travel through the earth’s interior.

Ram Poudel

International Association for the Integration of Science and Engineering (IAISAE) 


ABSTRACT

Our civilization has depended largely on cooperation among human beings. However, our science is yet to figure out ‘How did cooperative behavior evolve?’ This question from ‘What don’t we know’ series from the Science journal has been awaiting physical reasoning for a long time. We generalize the classical field theories for an ensemble of human beings and propose a new theory. The social field theory formalizes the energy of an individual in the social field. We underpin this new energy as a physical basis for cooperation among human and the evolution of human society.  

A fundamental understanding of why cooperation evolved may have a resounding effect on our understanding of social, political and economic rationale. Indeed, Darwin uncovered some general rationale of the cooperation. However, the science of evolution doesn’t provide physical reasoning, and also not adequate for the 21st century human consciousness.  Biologists are refining the Darwin’s ideas a bit by bit. Here, engineers aspire to uncover cooperative behavior in the terms of energy to be acknowledged by the learned societies. The human cooperation is not much different literally from cooperation that takes place between an electron and nucleons in a model of an atom.  It is our consciousness that makes cooperative behavior special among social beings.

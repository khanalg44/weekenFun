    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" At Jefferson Lab we recently conducted an experiment where an electron beam traveling almost at the speed of light was made to collide with several nuclear targets such as Deuterium, Beryllium, Carbon, and Boron. The aim of this experiment was to study how quarks, which are fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons, are changed when they are bound up inside a nucleus such as Carbon compared to free protons and neutrons that are not held inside nuclei. In the experiment the electrons that scatter off from the target nucleus are detected with a set of particle detectors attached to magnets that allow us to select electrons that are scattered at a fixed angle while carrying a fixed fraction of the electrons beam's energy. Knowing the energy and angle of the scattered electrons we can reconstruct the distribution of energy of the quarks inside the nucleus (called its structure function). We can then compare the structure functions of Be, C and B to those from Deuterium (an isotope of Hydrogen which we consider to be an almost free proton and neutron) to figure out how the quark distributions change when they are held together inside nuclei by the strong nuclear force. One of the goals of this experiment is to verify if the changes to the quark distributions are caused by the protons and neutrons that are closest to each other rather than all of the protons and neutrons in the nucleus.

    <td>" The results of in-situ radiological survey of Bagh Bhairav complex in Kirtipur, Nepal using portable gamma ray spectrometer (backpack) equipped with GPS and data logger unit is presented. The aim of the study is to assess external exposure by evaluating and mapping external absorbed dose rates and radionuclides activity concentrations in the study area. The measured absorbed dose rate in air was found in the range of 100.330 nGy/h to 170.506 nGy/h with average value 128.661 ± 14.637 nGy/h. The activity concentrations of the gamma radionuclides 238U, 232Th and 40K were found 85.340 ± 21.423 Bq/kg, 74.326 ± 13.899 Bq/kg and 978.901 ± 161.189 Bq/kg respectively. The absorbed dose rate in air was compared with the terrestrial data. The statistical analysis showed positive and linear correlation between them.  The absorbed dose rate was also calculated from the activity concentrations of gamma radionuclides and was compared with the measured absorbed dose rate in air. The calculated absorbed dose rate from terrestrial data and measured absorbed dose rate in air was found nearly equal which showed that gamma radiation in air was from natural terrestrial radiation. The Annual Effective Dose (AED) was calculated from the average of measured absorbed dose rate and was compared with the study of other places in different parts of the world. The outdoor AED and Excess Lifetime Cancer Risk (ELCR) is calculated 0.157 mSv/y and 0.519 × 10-3 respectively, which is higher than the world average value. Higher air absorbed dose rate is measured due to high activity concentrations of gamma radionuclides 238U, 232Th and 40K in soils and rocks. The primordial radionuclides in the earth crusts and building materials produces gamma radiation and contribute dose which is hazardous for the human health. So far no radiological data is available for studied area and the most area in Nepal, the data will be baseline data for Nepal.
Key Words: Absorbed dose rate, Activity concentration, AED, ELCR, In-situ radiological survey, Nepal

    <td>" Two-energy storage ring cooler is a new type of accelerator arrangement called energy recovered loop accelerator. The basic design idea of this type of accelerator is to have a low energy ring and a high energy ring connected by an energy recovered linac. Low energy ring has a cooling section where the cooling of ion beams occurs with interaction of electron beams through the process of coulomb scattering. Cooling allows small transverse beam sizes at the interaction point and enhance luminosity. Electron beams undergo synchrotron radiation damping when passing through the high energy ring. Such a storage ring electron cooler will benefit any ion storage ring or future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). "

    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" In modern physics, symmetry principles play a critical role in the study and formulation of the fundamental laws of physics. Charge symmetry is one such symmetry principle which says that the strong force which holds protons and neutrons inside nuclei is the same for protons and neutrons. Protons and neutrons are made up of quarks and the charge symmetry principle restated in terms of these underlying quarks which states that the distributions of up quarks in the protons is the same as the distribution of the down quark in the neutrons and vice-versa. Since the mass of the proton and neutron, as well as the up and down quark, differ by about 1% it is expected that charge symmetry is violated at the 1% level.  However, experimental data collected so far can only verify charge symmetry to
 < ±10%. Yet, charge symmetry has been universally assumed as a bedrock principle in studying the distributions of quarks inside protons and neutrons.

Jefferson Lab experiment E12-09-002 was the first experiment to try to remedy the situation by precisely measuring the charge symmetry violation with an uncertainty of 1%.  In this experiment, electrons traveling almost at the speed of light collided with a target made of liquefied deuterium. The scattered electrons produced in the collision along with another type of charged particle known as pions (made up of a quark and an anti-quark) were detected simultaneously in a set of detectors attached to magnets that allow us to select electrons that are scattered at a fixed angle while carrying a fixed fraction of the electron beam's energy. The experiment alternately detected positive or negative pions which help us extract the distribution of up or down quarks in the deuterium nucleus. By taking this special ratio of the positive pions to the negative pions produced in the electron-deuterium collisions we can look for charge symmetry violation with higher precision than ever before. We will show preliminary results from the experiment and talk about the current progress in data analysis.

    <td>" This paper presents the study of longitudinal beam dynamics of a linear accelerator, and simulation results for a model linear accelerator (LINAC) using Matlab. The study part the transition energy, particle acceleration, the transit time factor, RF factor, and momentum compaction are discuss. For the simulation, the model LINAC is build using a unit cells, and the unit cell consists of Quadrupole doublet and acceleration cavity. Model LINAC’s basic setup is present, and the simulation is on basis of the single particle analysis. The robustness of the model LINAC is test by varying different parameters, like, initial arrival phase, input energy. And the criteria to measure the robustness of the model LINAC are to check the kinetic energy at the end of the LINAC and the transverse stability of the transfer matrices of the each cell. The paper also presents the theoretical analysis of Phase stability at both below and above transition energy. stability of small and larger amplitude oscillations is present and simulation result for different particles each starting with different amplitude is see, where the large amplitude oscillation falls outside of the separatrix.

    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" Constructed in the sixties and seventies Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) was the biggest particle accelerator of its kind at the time. Quickly after construction, it had enabled many important high-energy particle physics experiments, including the discovery of quarks for the first time. It uses a 3.2-kilometer-long linear accelerator, which can accelerate particles to relativistic speeds, such as electrons reaching the energy in the access of 50 GeV. When the laboratory’s mission was re-defined in the years of 2,000, this giant accelerator has been repurposed to make the most powerful x-ray machine in the world, called the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). The first intense flashes of x rays were recorded in the summer of 2009, and since then SLAC has been a leading institute in ultrafast x-ray science. Key features of the LCLS include very high x-ray photon flux (10^12 x-ray photons per shot) and very short pulses (10 to 100 femtoseconds, where 1 fs = 10^-15 s). Therefore, it has enabled unprecedented imaging capabilities, as well as a new way to probe ultrafast processes in materials with element specificity. This talk provides a brief overview of the LCLS intended for wide range of research areas. "

    <td>" In this measurement, a pure 75Cu beam was developed at the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF) of Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL), and detailed β-decay studies of A = 75 decay chain was performed to understand the structure of corresponding daughter nuclei. Presented here is the case for 75Ga beta decay. Data on γ ray emission following β-decay, including βγ and γγ coincidences, were recorded, and the gated γγ spectra were analyzed to identify the statistically significant coincidences in cascades. The decay scheme developed from this work has been able to significantly increase both the number of energy levels and transitions. Finally, shell model-calculations are used for comparison to the observed level density. "

    <td>" STUDY THE MECHANOCHEMISTRY OF SILICON CARBIDE NANORIBBON (SiCNRs) BY USING FIRST PRINCIPLE

 

Mechanochemistry deals with the behavior of molecule under applied stress. Constrained Geometries Simulate External Forces method is used in order to study the behavior of Silicon Carbide Nanoribbon (SiCNR) to find their behavior under external stress. This approach is based on the scan of potential energy due to change in nanoribbon geometry. Thus, applied stress is the negative gradient of change in energy. A hybrid density functional B3LYP as implemented in Gaussian09 suites of program is used for energy scan of the nanoribbon under study. Method comprise constrained geometry optimization of the stretched nanoribbon along with their energy scan. The change in successive energies along with their change in length helps in determining the externally applied force. Finally this work calculates their Young modulus and force-extension curves. The study also includes some fundamental electronic properties that undergoes in nanosystem with the application of external force. "

    <td>" At Jefferson Lab we recently conducted an experiment where an electron beam traveling almost at the speed of light was made to collide with several nuclear targets such as Deuterium, Beryllium, Carbon, and Boron. The aim of this experiment was to study how quarks, which are fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons, are changed when they are bound up inside a nucleus such as Carbon compared to free protons and neutrons that are not held inside nuclei. In the experiment the electrons that scatter off from the target nucleus are detected with a set of particle detectors attached to magnets that allow us to select electrons that are scattered at a fixed angle while carrying a fixed fraction of the electrons beam's energy. Knowing the energy and angle of the scattered electrons we can reconstruct the distribution of energy of the quarks inside the nucleus (called its structure function). We can then compare the structure functions of Be, C and B to those from Deuterium (an isotope of Hydrogen which we consider to be an almost free proton and neutron) to figure out how the quark distributions change when they are held together inside nuclei by the strong nuclear force. One of the goals of this experiment is to verify if the changes to the quark distributions are caused by the protons and neutrons that are closest to each other rather than all of the protons and neutrons in the nucleus.

    <td>" The present paper inspects the ionospheric response in terms of Total Electron Content (TEC) during the Total Solar Eclipse of 22 July 2009. The ionospheric behaviour was investigated through the changes in TEC by using the data archived at BRN2, RMTE, DNGD, NPGJ, and TPLJ Global Positioning System (GPS) stations. Our study is based on GPS-TEC measurements from a widely distributed GPS network over different geographical location of Nepal by taking July 17-21 as pre-event, July 22 as a main-event and July 23-27 as a post-event and its comparison with International Reference Ionosphere (IRI-2016) model to reveal the potential of IRI model in special events like solar eclipse with storm effect. The total solar eclipse of July 22, 2009, was totally visible from BRN2 and RMTE stations and partially visible from DNGD, NPGJ, and TPLJ stations. The result reveals that the amount of reduction in TEC is proportional to the magnitude of the total solar eclipse. The latitude also depends on the magnitude of the solar eclipse but the longitude doesn’t depend on it. The latitude is obtained to be directly proportional to the effect of the solar eclipse while longitude shows the inverse effect. TEC depletion up to 5% from pre-event to main-event and enhancement up to 30% from main-event to post-event were observed during the totality of the eclipse.The eclipse was followed by the geomagnetic storm all over Nepal which lasted for 10 hours which was the reason for the enhancement of TEC up to 50% in the main-event day from pre-event and post-event. It was also found that the IRI-2016 model underestimates the GPS-TEC and doesn’t seem to be effective for a particular event.

Exotic electronic and quantum magnetic properties such as quantum phase transition, Anamolous hall effect, magnetic chirality is exhibited by kagome metals when individual atom of conductive material could be arranged in triangular pattern resembling kagome pattern. Our Density functional theory calculation for ScFe6Ge4 evidence that the total magnetic moment of 12.12 µB with ferromagnetic ground state which confirms magnetic nature. The study of electronic properties confirms metallic nature where Fe-3d shows the highest contribution at Fermi level in total DOS. Hybridization between Fe-3d and Ge-4p is observed around Fermi level. For the exchange correlation potential, generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is used. For computations FPLO code is implemented. The computation of wannier fitting based on wannier Hamiltonian indicates band crossing near Fermi level under application of pressure. "

    <td>" Interstellar space is not empty, but contains gaseous and particulate matter that is concentrated into very large region known as interstellar clouds. The presence of dust in the interstellar medium of galaxy dramatically affects their spectral appearance and interpretation of their underlying properties. The main evidence for interstellar gas rests on spectroscopy. The atoms, ions and molecules in the interstellar gas may emit or absorb radiation corresponding to transition between their various energy levels. The information carried by the electromagnetic spectrum may arises either in the formation of spectral lines, that is, in absorption or emission over a relatively narrow band of frequency, or in continuous emission or absorption over wide band of frequencies. Infrared radiation can be very beneficial for understanding structure of different chemical group that are present in molecules. This work investigates and presents electronic, structural and spectroscopic properties of carbon chained molecules and their isomers found in interstellar dust. Density functional theory as implemented in Gaussian 09 suites of program is used to get uv-vis spectroscopy, vibrational properties, electronic and structural properties of the carbon chained molecules in the interstellar dust.

Bare MXene(Ti3C2) are metallic as their parent MAX -phase(Ti3AlC2) but shows magnetic nature with certain magnetic moment. Surface termination like Ti3C2-Tx (-Tx are -OH , -F, or -O) helps to preserve Metallic nature but destroy Magnetic nature.

    <td>" A satellite is stable when it lies between the host planet’s Hill sphere and Roche limit. Hill sphere approximates the farthest gravitational influence a planet can have on its moons. If an object is gravitationally perturbed and pushed outside of this sphere, it will escape the orbit. Roche limit is the minimum distance from a center of a planet that a satellite can maintain stable orbits. Below this limit, the orbit decays and the satellite spirals into the host planet. In this work, we have determined orbital parameters that yield stable orbits for two hypothetical exomoons around a Jupiter-type exoplanet called Laliguras (HD-100777b) around the host star, Sagarmatha (HD-100777). We considered the mass of the exomoons to be equal to mass of Earth and mass of Moon.  For each set of the exomoon’s parameters, we plotted the Mean Exponential Growth for Nearby Orbits (MEGNO) maps to determine the range of exomoon’s periodic, aperiodic and quasi-periodic regions. Then, by selecting few points in these phase space maps, a direct orbital simulation is performed (for up to 50 Myr) to generate time series plots of the exomoons’ semimajor axis, eccentricity and other Keplerian elements. These time series plots are further analyzed to study the dynamics of the exomoons in 2-D and 3-D planes. "

    <th>Abstract</th>
    <td>" A one dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation method has been employed to study the effect of DC voltage and ion temperature on the properties of ion-ion plasma bounded by two symmetrical but oppositely biased electrodes. It is assumed that ion-ion plasma is collisionless and both the positive and negative ion species have same mass, temperature, and degree of ionization. Simulation results show that the formation of sheath and presheath regions and fluctuation of plasma parameters in that region are affected by the biasing voltage and ion temperature. It is found that the magnitude of electrostatic electric field at the vicinity of biasing electrodes is affected by the biasing voltage and ion temperature as well. This strong electric field close to the electrodes further prevents the flow of charged particles towards the electrodes. The presence of non-zero electric field at the quasineutral region suggests a presheath region similar to the electron-ion plasma. In the quasineutral region, the density of ions increases with the increase of biasing voltage and decreases with the increase in ion temperature of isothermal ions, respectively. Furthermore, the phase space diagrams for the ions are obtained which indicates the different regions of the plasma. The positive ions acquire negative velocity towards the negatively biased electrode and the negative ions acquire positive velocity towards the positively biased electrode. "

    <td>" The results of in-situ radiological survey of Bagh Bhairav complex in Kirtipur, Nepal using portable gamma ray spectrometer (backpack) equipped with GPS and data logger unit is presented. The aim of the study is to assess external exposure by evaluating and mapping external absorbed dose rates and radionuclides activity concentrations in the study area. The measured absorbed dose rate in air was found in the range of 100.330 nGy/h to 170.506 nGy/h with average value 128.661 ± 14.637 nGy/h. The activity concentrations of the gamma radionuclides 238U, 232Th and 40K were found 85.340 ± 21.423 Bq/kg, 74.326 ± 13.899 Bq/kg and 978.901 ± 161.189 Bq/kg respectively. The absorbed dose rate in air was compared with the terrestrial data. The statistical analysis showed positive and linear correlation between them.  The absorbed dose rate was also calculated from the activity concentrations of gamma radionuclides and was compared with the measured absorbed dose rate in air. The calculated absorbed dose rate from terrestrial data and measured absorbed dose rate in air was found nearly equal which showed that gamma radiation in air was from natural terrestrial radiation. The Annual Effective Dose (AED) was calculated from the average of measured absorbed dose rate and was compared with the study of other places in different parts of the world. The outdoor AED and Excess Lifetime Cancer Risk (ELCR) is calculated 0.157 mSv/y and 0.519 × 10-3 respectively, which is higher than the world average value. Higher air absorbed dose rate is measured due to high activity concentrations of gamma radionuclides 238U, 232Th and 40K in soils and rocks. The primordial radionuclides in the earth crusts and building materials produces gamma radiation and contribute dose which is hazardous for the human health. So far no radiological data is available for studied area and the most area in Nepal, the data will be baseline data for Nepal.

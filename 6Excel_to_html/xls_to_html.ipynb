      "    <td>\"The present paper inspects the ionospheric response in terms of Total Electron Content (TEC) during the Total Solar Eclipse of 22 July 2009. The ionospheric behaviour was investigated through the changes in TEC by using the data archived at BRN2, RMTE, DNGD, NPGJ, and TPLJ Global Positioning System (GPS) stations. Our study is based on GPS-TEC measurements from a widely distributed GPS network over different geographical location of Nepal by taking July 17-21 as pre-event, July 22 as a main-event and July 23-27 as a post-event and its comparison with International Reference Ionosphere (IRI-2016) model to reveal the potential of IRI model in special events like solar eclipse with storm effect. The total solar eclipse of July 22, 2009, was totally visible from BRN2 and RMTE stations and partially visible from DNGD, NPGJ, and TPLJ stations. The result reveals that the amount of reduction in TEC is proportional to the magnitude of the total solar eclipse. The latitude also depends on the magnitude of the solar eclipse but the longitude doesn’t depend on it. The latitude is obtained to be directly proportional to the effect of the solar eclipse while longitude shows the inverse effect. TEC depletion up to 5% from pre-event to main-event and enhancement up to 30% from main-event to post-event were observed during the totality of the eclipse.The eclipse was followed by the geomagnetic storm all over Nepal which lasted for 10 hours which was the reason for the enhancement of TEC up to 50% in the main-event day from pre-event and post-event. It was also found that the IRI-2016 model underestimates the GPS-TEC and doesn’t seem to be effective for a particular event.\n",
